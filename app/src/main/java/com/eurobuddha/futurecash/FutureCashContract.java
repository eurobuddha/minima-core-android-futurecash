 * script with {@code newscript} yields the canonical FutureCash address — a deterministic hash of the
 * cleaned script — so coins created here are interoperable with the web dapp (and vice-versa).
 *
 * It's a single-shot time-lock: a locked coin can be spent once the chain reaches the future block
 * (or the coin has aged enough), and only if the whole amount goes to the recipient stored in state[2].
